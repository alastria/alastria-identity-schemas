# VerifiableID for Legal Entity
This document defines the data model of VerifiableID for Legal Entities, a W3C compliant Verifiable Credential.<br>
<b>All EBSI descriptions modified to be AlastriaID compliant are striked out.</b><br><br>

Verifiable IDs are a special type of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that Natural Persons and Legal Entities can put forward as evidence of who they are (comparable to a passport or a physical ID card). In other words, Verifiable IDs serve to enable identification and authentication and as such contain digital claims about certain personal attributes. If someone provides, for example, a Verifiable ID that states information about this personâ€™s identity and is issued and signed by a government, service providers may trust and rely on this information (if they trust the government and the cryptography) to decide whether or not to conduct a transaction.

Verifiable ID is a Verifiable Attestation with the following top-level properties in the credentialSubject as defined in the table below.
